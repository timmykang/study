# Memory

Memory is a fun and secure web game. Players who beat it get a little prize.

Memory is written in go because go is memory-safe, which is very important for
a game like Memory with strict safety requirements.

## Build/Run

First install go. Version 1.12 is recommended, but 1.11 probably works.

Create the `flag.txt` file.

There are 2 ways to build/run: go modules, and GOPATH. Modules is the easiest
assuming you don't want to deploy to App Engine flex.

### Modules

Make sure whatever directory you're currently in is not a subdirectory of
`$GOPATH` (which is treated as `$HOME/go` if empty). Put the contents of the zip
file in a directory named `memory`, and enter that directory.

Initialize the module (this creates a `go.mod` file):

    go mod init memory

The next steps (`build`/`run`) will automatically install the necessary
dependencies using modules. See here for more details
https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#quick-start .

Run with visible binary

    go build
    ./memory

Run with non-visible binary

    go run memory

### GOPATH

Go to your `$GOPATH/src` directory. If `$GOPATH` is empty, it is assumed to be
`$HOME/go` so the full path then would be `$HOME/go/src` .

Put the contents of the zip file in a directory named `memory` there. So now for
example there is a file `$GOPATH/src/memory/game/game.go` .
Ensure there are no `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

Install the dependencies

    go get -u -v github.com/gorilla/websocket golang.org/x/crypto/argon2

Run with visible binary

    go build
    ./memory

Run with non-visible binary

    go run memory

## Deploy to App Engine flex

First do the GOPATH install method. Then deploy it. You can change the project
with the `--project` flag.

    gcloud app deploy

## flag.txt

The `memory` binary assumes that in the current directory there is a file named
`flag.txt` that doesn't contain a newline character. Create it.

    echo -n 'CTF{something}' > flag.txt
